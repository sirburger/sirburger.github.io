Hey, I am Junhui (a.k.a. @sirburger). I am a Cybersecurity Enthusiast by passion and a budding Security Engineer by training. While I specialize in cybersecurity, I am constantly exploring software engineering, web development, and data analytics to broaden my skill set and tackle multifaceted challenges.

I have experience deploying secure web applications, integrating machine learning for log analysis, and working on end-to-end encrypted cloud storage solutions. I’m particularly interested in penetration testing, vulnerability management, and data loss prevention. Recently, I have been diving into blockchain technology and its potential applications in security.

In the past, I contributed to multiple projects:

    Developed a cloud storage solution with QR-code-based client-side encryption as part of my ISPJ project.
    Built an e-commerce platform for a thrift shop, emphasizing security and transaction integrity.
    Participated in the CodeOverflow hackathon, creating a web platform promoting healthy eating and food waste reduction.
    Created challenges and assisted in running cybersecurity events such as CTFs and workshops with the NYP Infosec Club.

I’ve also achieved Top 15 in the YBN CTF and Top 8 in the Gryphon CTF with my team, demonstrating my aptitude for real-world cybersecurity challenges.

I am pursuing my studies at Nanyang Polytechnic, specializing in Cybersecurity. As part of my journey, I’m actively preparing for my upcoming internship at Continental Automotive Singapore, where I will focus on cybersecurity testing.
