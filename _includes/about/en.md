Hey, I am Rango (a.k.a. _@rangonomics_, _@wardn_). I am a Robotics Engineer by degree, but I consider myself a Software Engineer at the core and have not limited myself to Robotics and its transversal fields. I have deployed web apps for blockchain analytics, trading (don't use it) bots, investment analytics apps, web3 and many more projects.

In the past, I have led the development of Serena's Autonomous Navigation (ROS2, C++) stack at [Coalescent Mobile Robotics](https://cm-robotics.com/), worked at [Hiventive](https://www.hiventive.com/en/) both as a Back-End Software Engineer (Go, PostgreSQL) and as a Embedded Software Engineer (C++, C).

I have also been part of the Real Time Systems research team at [LS2N](https://ls2n.fr) for AI Planning, in which I have developed [pymapf](https://github.com/APLA-Toolbox/pymapf) (Multi-Agents Pathfinding Toolbox) and [pyddl](https://github.com/APLA-Toolbox/pythonpddl) (PDDL Parser/Planner).

I have interned at [Ingeniarius](https://ingeniarius.pt/), where I have worked on [STOP](http://stop.ingeniarius.pt/), [SAFE](http://safeforest.ingeniarius.pt/) and [SEMFIRE](http://semfire.ingeniarius.pt/).

I completed my BSc. in Electronics from [Nantes Université](https://english.univ-nantes.fr/), followed by a Master's in Embedded Systems at [Bordeaux Ynov Campus](https://www.ynov.com/campus/bordeaux). I then transfered for a Control and Robotics Master's at [Ecole Centrale Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/english-version), a top 5 graduate school in the country.

I now started the process of learning Blockchain Technology as well as their web integrations with web3.
