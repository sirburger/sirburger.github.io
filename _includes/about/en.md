# About Me

Hey, I am Junhui (a.k.a. @sirburger). I am a **cybersecurity enthusiast** by passion and a budding Security Engineer by training. While I specialize in cybersecurity, I am constantly exploring other disciplines such as **AI-driven threat detection** and **automation security**. With hands-on experience in **penetration testing**, **secure application development**, and participating in **global Capture The Flag (CTF)** competitions, I continuously explore the evolving world of cybersecurity to refine my skills and methodologies. I am driven to understand the inner workings & human flaws of something to completely understand how to exploit it.
