## My Role: Integrating the Spoonacular API

As the API integrator, I took charge of connecting our platform to the Spoonacular API, ensuring seamless access to dynamic recipe data. Here's a close-up of me presenting this key feature at the hackathon:

### Key Contributions
1. **API Integration**:
   - Researched the Spoonacular API documentation to identify useful endpoints.
   - Developed Flask routes to handle API calls and parse JSON responses.
   - Enabled filtering by calories, protein, dietary restrictions, and more.

2. **Data Parsing**:
   - Extracted essential data like recipe names, images, ingredients, and nutritional values.
   - Ensured a seamless user experience by displaying clean, structured results.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implemented mechanisms to manage API rate limits and invalid inputs.
   - Displayed fallback recipes or error messages when API calls failed.

4. **Caching**:
   - Reduced repetitive API calls by caching popular recipes, improving performance and staying within API usage limits.

### Challenges
- **Rate Limits**: Managing Spoonacular’s free-tier restrictions required optimizing API calls.
- **Complex Data**: Parsing and structuring the API’s large JSON objects into usable data for the website.
- **Custom Filtering**: Adapting API responses to support user-specific dietary needs and preferences.

This role taught me the importance of handling complex JSON data, implementing efficient caching, and managing API rate limits.
