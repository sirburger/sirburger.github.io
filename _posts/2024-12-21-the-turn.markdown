### The Turn

The Turn is where the story takes a sharp, exhilarating twist. Here, the hero begins to use the extraordinary powers or objects they’ve acquired, pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It’s in this moment that they do something incredible, something that shakes the very foundation of their world. The audience is caught in the spell of the spectacle—mesmerized by the act of magic. Yet, there’s an unsettling undercurrent. The success feels hollow. We are not yet convinced. We wonder, as all storytellers do, whether it will last. This is where the hero is tested not just by external forces, but by the dark truths of their own heart. They’ve done the impossible, but is it enough? The tension builds, and we are left to question: Will they truly keep their victory? This is the moment of the real challenge.

Django stood at the prow of the ship, hands gripping the wheel with an iron vice, eyes piercing the endless expanse of the Grand Line. The vast, unknowable ocean stretched before him—an empty void, but not one of peace. It was a sea of possibilities, each darker than the last. The world that had once called to him with promises of adventure now felt like a cage, its bars made of his own making.

The **Pledge** had been a quiet one, a whispered promise to himself, buried deep within the darkest recesses of his soul. He had once thought it a fleeting resolve, something made in a moment of weakness. But now, its weight gnawed at him. It was an ache that no amount of gold or conquest could soothe. He had hit rock bottom—there was no denying it. His body, once full of vitality, was broken. His mind, once sharp, now fragmented. Something deep inside him had snapped that night—the last vestige of the man he once was. That man was gone.

What remained was power.

It surged through him now, a dark force that twisted inside his veins like fire. The **Goru Goru no Mi** had changed him. It had taken root in him, reshaping his very being. Gold, once a mere symbol of wealth, now spilled from his fingertips like liquid fire. But it was not the precious metal he had once imagined. It was brittle, impure—an imitation of the real thing. And yet, it was power. A power that had consumed him. A power that made him unstoppable.

Gone was the charming rogue who once smirked through life’s challenges, charming his way out of every situation. That man had been weak. His hesitation, his mercy—it had all led to his downfall. The world had shown him its true face, and now, he would show it his own.

He turned to face his crew—the men and women who had followed him, believing in the glory of riches. They were blind. They thought this journey was about treasure, about gold. But Django knew the truth. It was about dominance. It was about control. And they would follow him, or they would die. There was no middle ground.

*"Ready the cannons,"* he ordered, his voice cold, sharp. It was no longer a voice of camaraderie. It was the voice of a king, a ruler. His words carried weight now. "Anyone who dares defy me will find their corpse floating in the ocean with a bullet between their eyes."

The crew scrambled to follow his orders, but Django's gaze remained fixed. His eyes were no longer just seeking treasure; they were searching for something far greater. Control. Absolute control.

A figure stepped from the shadows—**Frutsh**, her face twisted in uncertainty. She had once believed in Django’s charm, in the man beneath the rough exterior. But now, she saw something else. Something darker. The hesitation in her eyes was clear. She had witnessed the change in him—the monster he had become.

*"You're sure about this, Captain?"* Frutsh asked, her voice trembling. *"The Marines... they’ll come for us. They’ll—"*

*"They can try,"* Django interrupted, his voice colder than the ocean winds. *"But they won’t succeed."*

His mind was clear now. The self-doubt, the hesitation, the mercy—he had shed all of it. His desires, his thirst for power, it all flowed through him now like an unquenchable fire. He was done with hesitation. He was done with kindness. He had learned what the world was. And now, he would make it his.

The ship lurched violently as cannon fire echoed in the distance. The first signs of battle were near. But Django didn’t flinch. He stood tall, unshaken. His men scrambled around him, but he was beyond them now. They were pawns in a game he had already won.

A figure broke from the ranks—a coward, a traitor. He tried to run, to flee the oncoming chaos. But Django saw him. His eyes locked on the man, and with a mere thought, the traitor's body began to shift. It twisted, solidified, and in an instant, he was frozen in place—turned to solid gold. The man was nothing now, an empty vessel, a hollow statue. 

Frutsh gasped in horror, stepping back, but Django didn’t even glance at the fallen body. His eyes were fixed on the horizon. The prize was near.

*"I warned you,"* Django muttered under his breath, the words barely audible over the chaos. He turned back to the deck, his gaze hardening, the flicker of gold in his palm igniting with each new command.

*"Set sail,"* he ordered, his voice a low growl. His eyes narrowed, a spark of pure malice burning within. The ship surged forward, cutting through the waves, the chaos on the horizon growing closer. **Juicy Berry**—his prize—awaited.

With a flick of his wrist, Django summoned a barrier of gold, a shimmering wall that covered the side of the ship just as another cannonball sailed toward them. The impact was nothing. The cannonball bounced off the shield harmlessly. Django had become the storm. He was the sea now. The ocean would bend to his will.

As they neared **Juicy Berry**, a new thought crept into Django’s mind. It wasn’t just the gold or the power he sought anymore—it was dominance. He had become something far greater than any pirate. His vision had sharpened, his mind clear and unclouded. He was no longer a rogue. He was a king. And kings did not beg. They took.

He turned his gaze to Frutsh, who stood frozen beside him, her face pale. She had seen the cruelty in his eyes, the emptiness that had replaced the charm she once admired.

*"Do you understand now?"* Django asked, his voice low and deadly.

Frutsh stood still, her breath shallow. She nodded, her eyes wide with fear.  

Django had become the storm. Nothing; **nothing** would stop him now. This was no longer about gold. It was about control. Django had already decided—**he would control everything.**
