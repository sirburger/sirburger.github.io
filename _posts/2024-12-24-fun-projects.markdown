## Challenges

When I talk about all this building—spinning up AI tools, writing scripts, or coding random prototypes—I usually get asked: “But how much money do you make from it?” The answer, most of the time, is “none.” And that seems to leave people puzzled, like a hobby without a financial motive doesn’t make sense.
But let’s be real. We wouldn’t knock someone who enjoys playing basketball just because they’re not aiming to join the NBA. The same logic applies here. Even if I occasionally do this stuff during work hours, I’m not doing it for a direct payday—I’m doing it because the creative process is fun. I still have a life; I go out, catch movies, grab drinks, and hang at the beach. But I also love the late-night grind, the frustration, the “aha!” moments. If that makes me a sicko, so be it.

## The Shonen Spark
I realized quite some time ago that my love for building - or anything in this world than includes grinding - mirrors what anime fans call the Shonen Spirit. In series like Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball, you see heroes training relentlessly for the sheer thrill of self-improvement. They don’t always chase fame or fortune; they chase the next level—new forms, new power-ups. And it’s not just about power; it’s about resilience, kindness, obsession, and that carefree determination.
So, yes, I might not be hauling hundred-ton weights or launching Kamehameha waves, but I’m on my own training arc when it comes to software and product creation. Each new project is like discovering a different “quirk”—and I train it until it’s second nature.

## Final Thoughts
You don’t have to profit from something to love it. You don’t have to be a prodigy to find passion. And you definitely don’t need everyone’s approval to keep going. There’s joy in the process, in the challenge itself, and in measuring your growth against who you were yesterday. If that aligns with Shonen Spirit, then I guess I’m living my own anime arc.

Whether you’re building code, exploring your own unique quirk, or grinding out personal bests in sports, the goal is the same: keep training, keep learning, and keep being you. Another thing that makes it 10x better is finding people with the same mindset, surround yourself with them and build together. I know this might be a loner activity for most builders, but I've found sharing (even if I build my own thing and not as a group) experiences with these people transformative. That, in my book, is where the real fun begins.
